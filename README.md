# Getting Started

Welcome to the IntuitiveAI documentation. We have prepared this book to help understand how our IntuitiveAI algorithms work in details, so that it makes it easy for research/developers to expand this open-source algorithm.

The list given below should be followed in order so that it's easier to grasp the full knowledge of the IntuitiveAI.

1. **Wumpus World Simulation \(WWS\)** Understand how the simulation works. Rules that are in place, why those rules exist, and what are the statistics behind it.
2. **Understanding Generated Data** Data that is generated from each gameplay of WWS is stored in a particular manner. understand how it is structured and download data samples.
3. **Algorithm** â˜… Learn about the algorithm that IntuitiveAI is using and the new additions to them. We used MTCS but added our own factors to generate better intuitive results.
4. **Examples of Algorithm Usage** We ran the algorithm on different common world problems to see how it works and also compared the results with other algorithms.
