## To create your own simulator on web
1. Create a new firebase project and configure it for the web.
2. Enable firestore service on firebase
3. Clone the project
4. Open `app.js` file inside `JavaScript/public/` folder. [1]
5. Find the comment `//Add your firebase credentials here` and below it add your credentials for web.

THat's all you need to do. Run `index.html` on chrome or others and the simulator will be auto configured and when anyone will play it you'll start getting the data in your firebase firestore instance.
