# Getting Started

Intuitive AI is an experiment that was conducted to generate intuitive behavior in Artificial Intelligence and is still ongoing. In this official documentation, we are going to see how everything works step by step and also what are the future possible enhancements.

1. **Understanding Stimulator** In this section, we'll discuss in detail how the stimulator was developed what is the logic and rules behind it.
2. **Understanding Generated Data** Data that is being generated on every gameplay is being stored in a particular manner. So in this section, we are going to have a look at how the generated data looks like.
3. **EDA on Generated Data** Performing Exploratory Data Analysis \(EDA\) on the generated data. Putting it in shape and ensure that it is ready to be fed to a machine learning model.
4. **Experiments with DataSet** We fed the data to a neural network with a hypothesis that this neural network should never stop because it'll never improve or get better accuracy. This and some other interesting experiments we did with the data are all mentioned in this section.
5. **Future Enhancements** What is the future of this project and how can you advance this research.
